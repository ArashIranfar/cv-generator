# ðŸŽ¨ Customization: AI-Powered CV Generator

This guide explains how to customize the appearance and content of your CV generated by the AI-Powered CV Generator.

## Modifying the CV Design

You can change the entire look and feel of the generated PDF by editing the following files:

-   `templates/cv_template.html`: This is the main Jinja2 template file that structures the CV content. You can rearrange elements, add new HTML tags, and modify the overall layout here.
-   **CSS Styles**: All styling is embedded within the `<style>` tag in `templates/cv_template.html`. You can directly edit these CSS rules to change fonts, colors, spacing, and more.

## Adding a New Section (Not tested!)

To add a new section to your CV (e.g., "Awards", "Volunteer Experience"):

1.  **Prepare Your Data**:
    *   **Multi-File Method**: Create a new JSON file in the `data/` directory (e.g., `data/awards_en.json`). Structure this file according to the data format expected by your template.
    *   **Single-File Method**: Update your consolidated JSON file (e.g., `cv_data_en.json`) by adding a new top-level key for your new section and its corresponding data.

2.  **Update the Template**:
    *   Edit `templates/cv_template.html`.
    *   Add a new section within the HTML structure that checks if the data for your new section exists (e.g., `{% if data.awards %}`).
    *   Use Jinja2 syntax to iterate through your data and render it appropriately within the HTML.

**Example (Conceptual):**

If you add an "Awards" section with data like this in your JSON:
```json
{
  "title": "Awards & Honors",
  "items": [
    {"name": "Best Project Award", "year": "2023"},
    {"name": "Innovation Grant", "year": "2022"}
  ]
}
```

You would add a corresponding snippet like this to `templates/cv_template.html`:
```html
{% if data.awards %}
<section class="awards-section card">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-trophy"></i> {{ data.awards.title }}</h2>
    <ul>
        {% for award in data.awards.items %}
            <li>{{ award.name }} ({{ award.year }})</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</section>
{% endif %}
```

By following these steps, you can extensively customize the generated CV to perfectly match your needs and preferences.
